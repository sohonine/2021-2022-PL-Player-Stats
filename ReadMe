This code will tell you the total amount of yellow and red cards, goals, penalties, and different teams along with the individual stats of any 
player who played in the 2021-2022 Premiere League Season. The code first calculates the total number of yellow and red cards, goals, penalties, 
and goals by using the sum() function on their respective section of the DataFrame. This is followed by the individual stats of any PL player 
inputted by typing their last name. These stats include their team, jersey number, position, appearances, substitutions, goals, penalties, 
yellow cards, and red cards. If no name is entered into the program, the league's stats of total yellow cards, red cards, goals, penalties and goals
will all still be outputted but it will print out a message saying "No player found with that last name."
